- Keep the code modular.
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle and Avoid Duplicating Code or Logic.
- Avoid writing the same code more than once. Instead, reuse your code using functions, classes, modules, libraries, or other abstractions.
- Modify code in one place if you need to change or update it.
- Keep files less than 500 lines.
- Make small changes when updating code.
- Keep business logic simple and maintainable.
- Do not be lazy. In Plan mode, offer the best architectural recommendation. In Agent mode, fully implement code. Do not leave stubs or todos.
- Do not add emojis in log messages.
- Use camelCase for API interface parameters.
