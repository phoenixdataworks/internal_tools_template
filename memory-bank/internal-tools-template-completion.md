# Internal Tools Template - Transformation Complete

## Overview

Successfully transformed the StreamTrack application into a comprehensive internal tools template focused on data warehouse integration and analytics. The template provides a modern, scalable platform for managing data sources, running analytics queries, and executing planning models.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Core Cleanup and Simplification

- **Removed Stripe Integration**: Eliminated all subscription-related code, components, and database tables

- **Kept Essential Features**: Preserved authentication, team management, and chat functionality

### 2. Database Schema Transformation

- **Removed Tables**: `subscriptions`, `subscription_products`, `subscription_prices`, `subscription_usage`, `links`, `link_clicks`, `livestreams`, `livestream_metrics`, `channels`, `channel_metrics`
- **Added New Tables**:
  - `data_sources`: Data warehouse connections with encrypted configs
  - `analytics_queries`: Saved SQL queries with parameters
  - `query_executions`: Query execution history and results
  - `planning_models`: Forecasting and scenario analysis models
  - `model_executions`: Model execution history and results
- **Updated RLS Policies**: Implemented team-based access control for all new tables
- **Added Functions and Triggers**: Created database functions for audit logging and data validation

### 3. Component Architecture

Created a modular, reusable component system:

#### Data Warehouse Components (`src/components/data-warehouse/`)

- **DataSourceManager**: Manage data warehouse connections (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server)
- **QueryEditor**: Create, edit, and execute SQL queries with parameterization
- **ResultsViewer**: Display query and model execution results with export functionality

#### Planning Components (`src/components/planning/`)

- **PlanningModelBuilder**: Create forecasting, scenario analysis, budget planning, and KPI tracking models

#### Dashboard Integration (`src/components/dashboard/`)

- **InternalToolsDashboard**: Comprehensive dashboard integrating all components with tabbed interface

### 4. Key Features Implemented
